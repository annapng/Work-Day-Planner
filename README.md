# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Following the DU Bootcamp guidelines, I finished up a simple workday calender where you can store which tasks you'd like to accomplish in it over the course of the day. It dynamically changes the html and css based on the time of day, and retains information you've saved before.The application uses Day.Js and jQuery, both linked in the credits area.
